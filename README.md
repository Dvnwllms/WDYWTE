# Project Description

This is a simple app that allows the user to find a restaurant from a list of general topics or at random using our complex IDGAF algorithm. There are restaurants from a variety of cuisines from pizza and burgers to sushi and vegan. The experience is simplified to minimize the time between the user figuring out what to eat and actually eating. 

## Motivation for Development

We wanted to answer the ever present question “What do you want to eat?” which is often followed by an “I don’t know, what do you want to eat?” This is a cycle that needs to be stopped. Many people are starving because they have no idea on what/where to eat. DC is city that sees many different cultures of individuals.  This is evident in the food scene.  We want to give people an avenue to explore the wide variety of food options that they have but may not be fully aware of. We also just wanted a space to share our passion which is food and point people to awesome places we enjoy.
